Your role as a family, friend and/or caregiver is essential in helping to promote engagement in the provided activities for the person living with dementia. Your support and approach can make a meaningful difference in the day of your affected friend or family member.

**Do:**  ✅

1.  Provide clear and simple instructions
    
2.  Break down activities into smaller steps 👣
    
3.  Allow extra time for the person living with dementia to process and respond to instructions🕚
    
4.  Provide/offer assistance and support as needed, but try to promote independence and allow the person living with dementia to complete tasks to the best of their ability (even if it is not completed correctly). They may need help starting the activity.
    
5.  Encourage and praise 👏👏🏾
    

**Do Not:** ❌

1.  Criticise, argue or correct: (let them complete the activity as they see it)
    
2.  Rush or pressure 🏃🏽‍♂️
    
3.  Overwhelm with choices
    
4.  Use negative language: Avoid “no”, “you can’t do that” or “you’re doing it wrong.”🙅🙅🏾‍♂️ Instead, use positive language and offer praise and encouragement for efforts made👍🏼
