Sensory stimulation and touch activities can be helpful for people living with dementia, as they can provide a range of benefits, including promoting relaxation, reducing agitation, and enhancing mood. People living with dementia experience changes in their ability to process and respond to sensory information: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.  Our senses are critical for interacting with our  environment. Research has shown that sensory stimulation and touch activities can help improve mood and reduce behavioural symptoms in people living with dementia.
