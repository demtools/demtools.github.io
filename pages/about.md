# **Understanding dementia**

Dementia affects everyone differently and symptoms can vary by person and by day. People living with dementia can continue to do many things, depending on the symptoms. For example, they may continue to:

- work for years after symptoms begin
- take part in social events and favourite activities
- take care of family members

Learn more about dementia by:

- connecting with your local dementia organization such as an Alzheimer Society
- reading, listening to podcasts or watching videos from evidence-based sources
- talking to medical experts, such as:
  - doctors
  - nurse practitioners

# **Confronting stigma**

Uninformed attitudes and beliefs about dementia can result in stigma, which can affect people living with dementia, their loved ones and caregivers. Stigma can:

- cause social isolation
- make people feel alone, depressed and ashamed
- erode someone's sense of self-worth and belief in their own abilities

To discourage stigma and negative perceptions associated with dementia, you can:

- correct misinformation related to fears about and negative attitudes toward dementia
- learn more about dementia
- help people living with dementia to overcome challenges of stigma by:
  - making efforts to include them in conversations and/or activities
  - treating them with respect and dignity
  - encouraging them to share their experiences
- refuse to accept actions and language that are:
  - belittling
  - dehumanizing
  - discriminatory
  - patronizing
- speak out against inappropriate behaviour directed at people living with dementia

### **Self-stigma**

Self-stigma occurs when someone internalizes negative attitudes about a condition and applies those attitudes to themselves. This can cause people who are experiencing potential symptoms of dementia to be less likely to seek help. Self-stigma may result in:

- hiding symptoms
- avoiding discussions with loved ones
- having negative thoughts and feelings
- delaying an assessment that may lead to a diagnosis

People living with diagnosed dementia may hide the diagnosis from others and isolate themselves.

### **Where stigma comes from**

Negative perceptions about dementia can affect how people view, talk about and interact with people living with dementia. In Canada:

- 49% of people worry they may develop dementia
- 64% of people worry someone close to them will develop dementia
- 68% of people agree that others have negative assumptions about the abilities of people living with dementia
- almost 60% of people worry that people would treat them differently if they had a dementia diagnosis

This worry can come from a lack of knowledge, and can be further complicated by:

- fear
- stereotypes
- age discrimination (ageism)
- cultural and spiritual beliefs

# **How to communicate**

Not everyone experiences the same dementia symptoms nor do they exhibit the same behaviours. As a result, some communication methods may work well for one person living with dementia, but not for another. Something that works well one day may not get the same results the next time.

It's important to understand the reasons and emotions behind the behaviour you may see in a person living with dementia. Feelings of anxiety, distrust and disorientation can affect how they communicate.

Be aware of how you talk, listen and behave. This will help you to have positive and supportive interactions with someone living with dementia. For instance, approach a person living with dementia from the front, rather than from behind as it may startle them.

While there are many detailed resources available, here are some helpful tips to remember when communicating:

Be respectful

Listen actively

Speak with care and empathy
