Welcome to Dementia-Tools, a Canadian company dedicated to enhancing the lives of people living with dementia by offering a variety of evidence-based tools and activities that provide stimulation and purpose. Dementia can present many challenges, including cognitive decline, social isolation, and a loss of purpose and identity. Cognitive stimulation is important for maintaining brain health and promoting memory recall. We offer a range of evidence-based tools and activities designed to address these challenges and promote overall well-being. Our activities also promote engagement and connection with family, friends and caregivers, who are an important part of the dementia care process.  We recognize that  we are unable to know each person living with dementia and their specific needs, however, we believe our evidence-based tools and activities can make a difference and are proud to offer them to our community.

**How it Works:**

Dementia-Tools is a subscription service that delivers a new dementia activity to your doorstep every month. Each activity is selected to be engaging, stimulating, and enjoyable. Our subscription service is simple and flexible. Sign up for a monthly subscription and cancel at any time. We understand that life can be unpredictable and circumstances can change, so we want to make it easy for you to manage your subscription. Our goal at Dementia-Tools.com is to provide tools and activities that promote engagement, communication, and social interaction that enhance the quality of life for those living with dementia. You can look forward to receiving a new dementia activity every month to use and engage with your family or friend living with dementia. We are confident that our subscription service will be a valuable addition in your dementia journey and we look forward to serving you.
