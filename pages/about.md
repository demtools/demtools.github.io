Welcome to Dementia-Tools, a Canadian company dedicated to enhancing the lives of individuals living with dementia and supporting caregivers in engaging and bonding with people  living with dementia through activities. We understand the unique challenges faced by those living with dementia and their families and friends. Dementia can present many challenges, including cognitive decline, social isolation, and a loss of purpose and identity.
