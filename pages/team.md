| A registered nurse with 27 years of experience, Marie has had the privilege of working in various nursing and leadership roles in the community, hospital, and long-term care. It was during these years that she found her passion for working with seniors and learning more about dementia. Her personal experiences with family living with dementia has also provided insight into the challenges faced by caregivers. Witnessing both patients and family members living with dementia sitting idly with no stimulation or purposeful activities, motivated Marie to start Dementia-Tool.com, a company dedicated to providing tools and activities to enhance the lives of individuals living with dementia and their caregivers. Marie endeavours to enrich the lives of those living with dementia and to bring joy and purpose to their daily lives. 	|   	| Rod is a seasoned Business and Technology executive who is very active in the startup community.
